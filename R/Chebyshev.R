# Create the equivalent of a Vandermonde matrix but using Chebyshev polynomials.
# The prior "outer" call on based on the old ChebPoly was ported to C to a
# nested loop. For some reason, calling outer on the C version of chebPoly did
# not work properly. But once the entirety of the matrix build was moved to C,
# and chebPoly removed completely, it became moot.

# Function to evaluate Chebyshev polynomials and their coefficients. Originally
# was drop(chebMat(x, length(a) - 1L) %*% a). Ported to C and uses R's C
# interface to DGEMV. This is 15%â€“25% faster than the ported chebMat and %*%.
